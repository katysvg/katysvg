Findings: I found that the stae of Vermont had the most amount of workers compensation claims.

Data analysis process: I requested data from the state of Vermont, cleaned it and analyzed it with pandas to get rid of duplicates, etc. I classified it with AI and then made charts.

Things I learned: This was a large data set with about 80,000 differnet claims. I learned how to analyze data with pandas, classify data with AI, and how to create charts with DataWrapper and Flourish.
