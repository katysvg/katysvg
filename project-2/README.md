Title : Bites, Falls, and Zipline Tragedies

What I wanted to accomplish: I wanted to find out how many workers compensation claims there were in Vermont over the past five years.

Findings: I found that the stae of Vermont had the most amount of workers compensation claims.

Data collection process: I requested a csv file from the state of Vermont.

Data analysis process: I requested data from the state of Vermont, cleaned it and analyzed it with pandas to get rid of duplicates, etc. I classified it with AI and then made charts.

Things I learned: This was a large data set with about 80,000 differnet claims. I learned how to analyze data with pandas, classify data with AI, and how to create charts with DataWrapper and Flourish.  

If I had more time: I'd request and look at the cost of the claims for the state of Vermont and dig deeper into the more unique claims, and interview employers about these claims.
