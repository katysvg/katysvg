        <p>New Hampshire is facing a severe housing crisis — and the rise in short-term rentals may be making it worse. A new analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute estimates the state needs 23,500 additional housing units right now. That number is projected to swell to 90,000 by 2040.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, thousands of homes are being pulled from the long-term housing market and converted into short-term rentals, some of them by out-of-state investors looking to profit from New Hampshire's tourism economy.</p>

        <p>Short-term rentals (STRs) are typically residential units rented for fewer than 30 days. Vacation Rentals by Owner (VRBO) launched in 1995, but the real boom began in the 2010s with platforms like Airbnb and FlipKey, making it easier for anyone to turn a home into a vacation listing. Increasingly, investors are driving that trend.</p>

        <p>But New Hampshire's laws haven't kept pace. Only 30 of the state's 234 municipalities have any local STR regulations, the NH Office of Planning and Development told the New Hampshire Bar Association. In 2019, the state Supreme Court upheld Portsmouth's right to restrict STRs in certain zones, but enforcement remains inconsistent and varies by town.</p>

        <div class="map-legend">
            <span><span class="legend-dot dot-black"></span>Homes for sale</span>
            <span><span class="legend-dot dot-red"></span>Airbnb rentals</span>
        </div>

        <p>In Portsmouth, a major tourist hub, the imbalance is striking. As of early June, there were nearly twice as many active Airbnb listings (220) as homes for sale (119). Of those for sale, just 64 were single-family homes.</p>

        <p>Statewide, the numbers tell a story of strain. Nearly 9% of New Hampshire’s housing is considered "seasonal." And 43.6% of short-term rentals are owned by out-of-state hosts. With an aging population and slower rates of new construction, the diversion of homes into the tourist economy is tightening the housing crunch, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.</p>

        <p>That pressure is spreading. For every unemployed worker in New Hampshire, there are almost two open jobs. Homelessness has surged 49.5% since 2020. Student homelessness alone rose 7% in a single year. Meanwhile, new construction lags far behind demand — with just 2,101 housing permits issued in 2011 compared to more than 9,000 annually in the early 2000s.</p>

        <p>Legislative attempts to address the issue have been uneven. Senate Bill 249, which aimed to prevent towns from banning STRs in single- and two-family homes, failed to pass. Critics saw it as undermining local control; supporters saw it as necessary consistency.</p>

        <p>The consequences are steepest for the most vulnerable. Over half of renters in the state are considered housing cost-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on rent. The median home price now stands at $540,000. Monthly mortgage payments are nearing $4,000. Rents have spiked too — a two-bedroom now averages $1,833, a 36% increase since 2019.</p>

        <p>Homelessness among families is up nearly 46%, and among seniors, more than 12%. The longer housing remains out of reach for working families, the more New Hampshire risks becoming a place only the wealthy can afford to call home.</p>
