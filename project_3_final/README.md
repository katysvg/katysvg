Title : New Hampshire's highest-paid worker? A corrections officer

What I wanted to accomplish: I wanted to find how much state employees in New Hampshire are paid. 

Findings: I found that the highest-paid employees are correctional officers, largely becuase they are paid a crazy amount of overtime.  

Data collection process, with links: I used the state website: https://business.nh.gov/paytransparency/

Data analysis process: I analyzed an excel file with pandas to find the highest paid worker, including the amount of overitme that was paid.

Things I learned: I learned how to create a scrollytelilng story. 

If I had more time: I would have liked to look at the data over multiple years to see if there's been any changes.I would have liked to know exactly how many hours of overtime each person worked.
