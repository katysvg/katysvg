Title : How Vacation Listings are Reshaping Portsmouth, New Hampshire’s Housing Market  

What I wanted to accomplish: I wanted to find out how many Airbnb listings there are in Portsmouth, NH and compare that to how many homes there were for sale. 


Findings: I found that the number of Airbnbs is about double the number of homes for sale.

Data analysis process
I scraped the real estate website and scraped airbnb listings in Portsmouth, NH. I then used pandas to analyze csv files. I created a bar chart with Flourish and a map with Mapbox Studio.
