Title : How Vacation Listings are Reshaping Portsmouth, New Hampshireâ€™s Housing Market

What I wanted to accomplish: I wanted to find out how many Airbnb listings there are in Portsmouth, NH and compare that to how many homes there were for sale.

Findings: I found that the number of Airbnbs is about double the number of homes for sale.

Data collection process, with links: I used these sources: https://www.coldwellbanker.com/sitemap/new-hampshire-real-estate https://apify.com/tri_angle/airbnb-scraper https://nhfpi.org/resource/housing-in-new-hampshire-shortage-raises-costs-2/

Data analysis process I scraped the real estate website and scraped airbnb listings in Portsmouth, NH. I then used pandas to analyze csv files. I created a bar chart with Flourish and a map with Mapbox Studio.

Things I learned I learned how to scrape data, how to analyze data with .csv files, how to create a map with Mapbox, and how to make a chart with Flourish.
